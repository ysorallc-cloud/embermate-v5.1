## Frequently Asked Questions

**A**: No. All your data is on your device. Simply delete it using Method 1 or 2 above.

### Q: Will EmberMate have any of my data after I delete the app?
**A**: No. We never stored your data on our servers, so there's nothing to delete on our end.

### Q: Can I recover my data after deletion?
**A**: No. Deletion is permanent and immediate. There is no recovery option unless you exported a backup beforehand.

### Q: What if I want to delete data for just one family member?
**A**: Go to **Settings** → **Patient Management** → Select the patient → **Delete Patient Profile**. This removes only that patient's data.
